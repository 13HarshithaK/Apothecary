# Apothecary
Java (Netbeans) based Medical Store management system <br/>
I wasnt too sure about uploading a netbeans project so I uploaded all the files. The jar files are in the 'dist' folder. The forms and java files are in the 'src' folder. <br/>
This project was for my Software Engineering and Object Oriented Software Engineering semester end Project.
